                <p> My name is Alex Kozachuk and I was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. I attended school at the Center for Emergency
                    Medicine in Pittsburgh where I obtained my EMT certifications as well as my CPR Instructor certifications.
                    While in school, I met my future wife and we have been married for almost 2 years. After living in Pittsburgh
                    for about 8 years, we moved to Charlotte where I gained employment with Rite Aid pharmacy training their
                    technicians and wellness ambassadors in addition to contracting vaccine clinics and health fairs. After
                    spending 3 years in Charlotte, my wife and I moved to Raleigh in November of 2017.
                </p>

                <div class="clearfix"></div>

                <p> In my spare time, I enjoy going to anything food related whether its trucks, breweries, festivals, or whatever
                    may be in between. My favorite meal is chicken carbonara. My favorite brewery so far in Raleigh is between
                    Big Boss, who has an amazing playlist of all the bands I listened to during high school, and Little City
                    that always has great sours available; try the
                    <em> Plethora.</em> I am also an avid gamer, having been heavily involved in the
                    <em> Paragon </em>
                    community prior to the game being shut down. </p>

                <p> I look forward to learning about web development and all the opportunities this new career path can offer
                    me. Ideally, I would like to use my knowledge and skills gained to work specifically in the food industry
                    or gaming industry. My current path is to use my medical background to first gain an opportunity to further
                    develop my skills and gain work experience in the field.
